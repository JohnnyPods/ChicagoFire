    "Title":"Opening Day Victory For The 2015's",
    "P1": "A new team has assembled for the 2023-2024 season, the Chicago Fire 2015 sets off on their final Mite season.  It didn't take long for these boys to hit the score sheet with 3 players tallying goals in the first period. Everett Hollingsworth kicked off the scoring on a coast-to-coast goal to get things started",

    "P2":"The next 2 goals were textbook rebounds by Colton Podgurski and Emerson Fina coming off of Cade Gustkowski shots from the point.  Although the visiting Admirals tallied 2 in the 2nd, Everett was able to secure a 2 goal lead in the 3rd off a puck strip and finish on the back hand.",

    "P3":"The game was finally sealed with an empty net goal and hat trick for Hollingsworth. Always nice to kick off the season with a win and something for this young group to build off of. See you next weekend for the double header against Mission"
