    "Title":"Opening Day Victory For The 2015's",
    "P1":"In front of a packed house on opening weekend the 2015's faced off against the Milwaukee Junior Admirals.  The Admirals came out quick to start the game and put the first goal on the board. The Fire were able to answer back late in the 1st when Weissenhofer buried home a rebound from a LaFrance shot on net from the point.",
    "P2":"The 2nd period was a physical battle with multiple penalites on both sides of the ice, neither team was able to capitalize on the power-play that saw more physical play than the refs were willing to let go.  A break in the tie finally came when Perry caught the Admiral defense pinching and sailed a lob pass out of the zone to the Fire forwards.  Hollingsworth was able to move the puck ahead to Trafficanta who went backhand-forehand and put the puck in the back of the net to give Fire the lead.",
    "P3":"Going into the 3rd the Admirals took command of the game and were able to score back to back, one on the Power-play to give them the lead.  The Fire found themselves shorthanded once again, however Perry was able to send a clear out of the zone to a breaking Gutkowski who outhustled all the Admirals and burried a top-shelf shot to tie it up once again. Minutes later the Admirals once again took there 3rd lead of the game and put the Fire in need of another goal to tie it up",
    "P4":"With 90 seconds left in the game, Fire Coaches decided to call a timeout and take the gamble of getting a 6th skater on the ice.  With a couple of close calls and a blocked shot to keep the game alive, LaFrance in desperation kept in a last second clearing and sent the puck on net.  Perna was able to muscle his way through an Admiral defender, and get the puck to the front of the net where Trafficanta was able to slam home the rebound and give the Fire the tie with 37 seconds left.  With the game tied up Perry decided to finish the Playmaker (3 Assists) and send a clearing puck back to Trafficanta who took a hit which gave Scanlon the puck with 15 seconds left.  With the game on the line Scanlon was able to beat the goalie over his shoulder and play hero for the game. With a wild finish the 2015's are off to a great start, See you next game!!!"
